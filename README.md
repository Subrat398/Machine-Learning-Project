# 🩺 Breast Cancer Detection System

This project is a machine learning-based Breast Cancer Detection System built using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset. It uses data visualization, preprocessing, and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to identify malignant and benign tumors.

## 🚀 Features

- Data loading and exploration using `scikit-learn`
- Visual data analysis using `seaborn` and `matplotlib`
- Data preprocessing and normalization
- Model training using Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

## 📁 Project Structure

- `breast_cancer_detection.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook containing all code, explanations, and results.
- `README.md`: Project overview and usage instructions.

## 🧪 Dataset

- **Source**: [Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer.html)
- **Features**: 30 numerical features computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast mass.
- **Target**: Binary classification — Malignant (0) or Benign (1)

## 📊 Visualizations

The notebook includes:
- Correlation heatmap
- Distribution plots of key features
- Pair plots for relationships between features

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (SVM, model evaluation)
